		<h2>Jesus Christ is our savior</h2>
		<p>
			This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why:
			so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting
			life. (John 3:16)
		</p>

		<p>
			God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for
			us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath
			through Him. (Rom 5:8, 9)
		</p>

		<p>
			For all have sinned; all fall short of God’s glorious standard. Yet now God in his gracious
			kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by
			taking away our sins. For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy
			God’s anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood,
			sacrificing his life for us. God was being entirely fair and just when he did not punish those
			who sinned in former times. And he is entirely fair and just in this present time when he
			declares sinners to be right in his sight because they believe in Jesus. (Rom 3:23-26)
		</p>

		<p>
			So also Christ died only once as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will
			come again but not to deal with our sins again. This time he will bring salvation to all those
			who are eagerly waiting for him. (Heb 9:28)
		</p>

		<p>
			He personally carried away our sins in his own body on the cross so we can be dead to sin and
			live for what is right. You have been healed by his wounds! (I Pet 2:24)
		</p>

		<h2>Jesus Christ is our healer</h2>
		<p>
			Jesus Christ took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken
			by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was
			crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his
			wounds we are healed. (Isa 53:4, 5)
		</p>
		<p>
			“By what power or what name did you do this?” Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to
			them: “Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being called to account today for an act of
			kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the
			people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom
			God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. He is “the stone you
			builders rejected, which has become the capstone. ‘Salvation’ is found in no one else, for
			there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:7-12)
