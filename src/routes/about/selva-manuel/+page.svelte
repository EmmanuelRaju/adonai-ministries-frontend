		<h3>Gates of hell will not prevail against you</h3>
		<p>
			Selvakumar Manuel moved from India to New York city in 1992 not to serve the Lord but to work
			in a secular job. The abnormal results of a routine physical exam caused him to end up in an
			Oncologist’s office and was found to have all his major bones dry and empty. On January
			1st,1998, the Cancer specialist gave him thirty days to live. One day on that winter morning
			as he was contemplating the life of his family after his death, he suddenly heard an audible
			voice from the ceiling that said, “Gates of hell will not prevail against you.” In the
			hopeless situation came a little hope. The same Lord Jesus Christ who spoke to Peter in
			Matthew 16:18, spoke to Selva.

		<h3>Rejection of Godly counsel</h3>
		<p>
			To the doctor’s amazement his blood counts improved in six months. Further tests revealed the
			bones were still empty, but the blood was being produced. Servants of God started telling him
			that God is calling him for ministry, the one thing that Selva could not do. He rejected their
			counsel and resumed his secular job.

		<h3>Calling of Selvakumar Manuel</h3>
		<p>
			After 5 years of miraculous recovery his blood counts started dropping again. Bro. Selva
			realized his disobedience to God’s calling and returning to his old life cost his healing. He
			implored the Lord persistently to give him another chance and to speak to him again as the
			Lord spoke to him in the winter of 1998.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our God is gracious Lord. Selva Manuel’ s life’s direction changed forever on September 21,
			2003 at 3am when a gushing wind surrounded him as he was worshipping the Lord and he heard a
			soft gentle audible voice near his right ear, “Isaiah 42:6,7.” With trembling he opened the
			Word and read -

			cite="Isaiah 42:6,7 (AMP)"

			He surrendered his life unto the Lord with this prayer <br /><br />
