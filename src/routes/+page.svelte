		On August 15, 2013, Bro.Selva Manuel was awakened from his sleep by a dream. In that dream, he
		saw the people of the city were downcast. Military police were standing in every part of the
		city. There was a long line of people dressed in black suits and they were entering a big
		auditorium, dropping their Bibles in a large bowl which was kept in front of the stage. The
		large bowl was dark red in color with three thin yellow stripes on the brim of the bowl. A
		soldier was guarding the bowl. The pews were empty. Selva was alone sitting in one of the pews.
		He saw a preacher who was standing on the stage surrounded by a few people. As Selva was looking
		at the preacher, a cloud covered the preacher and he saw above the stage in big three
		dimensional lighted letters
