		On August 15, 2013, Bro.Selva Manuel was awakened from his sleep by a dream. In that dream, he
		saw the people of the city were downcast. Military police were standing in every part of the
		city. There was a long line of people dressed in black suits and they were entering a big
		auditorium, dropping their Bibles in a large bowl which was kept in front of the stage. The
		large bowl was dark red in color with three thin yellow stripes on the brim of the bowl. A
		soldier was guarding the bowl. The pews were empty. Selva was alone sitting in one of the pews.
		He saw a preacher who was standing on the stage surrounded by a few people. As Selva was looking
		at the preacher, a cloud covered the preacher and he saw above the stage in big three
		dimensional lighted letters: <strong class="uppercase">preach</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The deepest desire of our hearts is for the glorious Gospel be preached to people of different
		nations and tongues and the people to experience our Lord as their Lord.

		Our confidence and steadfast reliance and absolute trust that we have, is through Christ toward
		God. Not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us,
		but our sufficiency and qualifications come from God – (2 Coranthians 3:4,5 AMP)

		Lord has commissioned each one of us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and take care of the
		widows. What a great privilege it is for you and me to be called as <strong class="uppercase"
