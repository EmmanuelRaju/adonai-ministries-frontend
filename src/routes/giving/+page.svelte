		Blessed of God, We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for standing with us with your
		earnest prayers and sacrificial offerings unto the Lord. Together we are reaching people of
		different nations and tongues with the Living Word of the Loving God. Lord Jesus Christ Saves,
		Heals, Delivers, Restores, Edifies and Sanctifies. Hungry are fed; Naked are clothed; Widows are
		taken care.
	</p>
	<p>
		We invite you to please consider becoming “Adonai’s Friend”, by your monthly financial
		partnership with this Blessed ministry. The Bible declares in II Corinthians 9: 8 [AMP],” God is
		able to make all grace [every favor and earthly blessing] come in abundance to you, so that you
		may always [under all circumstances, regardless of the need] have complete sufficiency in
		everything [being completely self-sufficient in Him], and have an abundance for every good work
		and act of charity.” It is our sincere promise to you that we will fervently pray for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recurring Authorization Policy: Please note that your first offering will be processed within
		one business day. Your next deduction date will be 7th of every month. Your authorization will
		remain in effect until Adonai’s Ministries International received notification from you of its
		termination in such time and in such manner as to afford Adonai’s Ministries International and
		Depository a reasonable opportunity to act on it. All offerings, less the value of product
		received are tax deductible as allowed by IRS regulations. Upon receipt of sufficient funds for
		a specific project, support will be used for an equally important outreach.
