		title: 'I was given few days to live because of all the major organs failure',
		description: `On 9/2/17 during "Adonai's Gathering" one family showed up from NJ. We learned from him that he was the one who was given only few days to live as his major organs have failed. This happened one year ago when someone gave Bro.Selva his number to call him on the phone to pray for him. Jay walked into the meeting just to give glory to God and after the meeting he sat with us for about 2 hours to let us know how God has delivered him and has been giving him Angelic visitations. We truly serve the living God indeed. We joined with him in praising God as the Bible declares in Psalm 66: 19,20,"Certainly God has heard us; He has attended to the voice of our prayer. Blessed be God, who has not turned away our prayer, nor His mercy from us!" Dear friend, our God shows no partiality. He is able to heal you and deliver you from no matter what you are going through. Is anything impossible for the Lord? (Gen 18:14).`

		title: 'Multi organ auto-immune disease and Diabetes – God healed me miraculously',
		description: `04/10/2015   It is a great privilege to come before you to glorify HIS name with a great testimony in my life with the power of the Holy Ghost. I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis for the first time in 2007. Over a period of time, it aggravated and I was forced to go to the Rheumatologist due to the severity of the disease. I started taking medication in early 2010. Since then, I have been taking a very dangerous, anti-cancerous medications. This is a hereditary and an auto immune disease – it has no cure as per medical sciences. I was also diagnosed for the first time with diabetes and started taking medication. I have a strong family history of diabetes. This is a hereditary and a multi-organ auto immune disease – no cure as per medical sciences. On top of that I have neck pain, back pain and joint pains (small joint pains & large joint pains) – these were causing hindrance to my daily activities every day.This is the history of diseases/sickness in my body before I received the healing from God on January 20 th 2015. One day in 2011, I met Pastor Selva Manual and his family in my church who shared his living testimony in brief. I recognized that the words he spoke had a power of the Holy Ghost. I thought I should meet him personally and know more about how he received healing from God and What the Word of God is saying about the disease/sickness in a born again believer; Since then, I started going to Adonai’s Gatherings and participating in the prayer meetings regularly. Pastor Selva always showed love and compassion towards me and sincerely requested God to heal me completely and after prayer he used to say to me “You will stop the medication; God is healing you”.Bible says according to Psalm 34:17, The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; He delivers them from all their troubles.<br/>
    Faith in me started growing and I started enjoying His presence every day. Finally, I have received complete healing from God on January 20th 2015. Now I am completely free from Psoriatic Arthritis, Diabetes, Neck Pain, Back pain, Joint Pains (small joint pains & large joint pains) and I have stopped taking medication since January 25th2015. Then I remembered Pastor Selva Manual’s words that he used to tell me “You will stop the medication, God is healing you”.<br/>
    I went to my Rheumatologist, in the 1stweek of March to explain How God healed me miraculously. Then my doctor said, “I agree with you and I cannot argue on the healing you received from God and I will not recommend any medication further; but let me take your blood samples to see the reports since you are here today”. After one week, I received the blood test reports on March 13th, 2015 from the clinic. It is too long to list all the tests the doctor has done. Every thing became normal.I would like to thank Pastor Selva Manual and his family.<br/>
    Thank you Lord Jesus. Glory to God.<br/>
    Never a disease that JESUS CHRIST cannot heal.<br/>
    Never a sickness that JESUS CHRIST cannot cure.<br/>
    Never a problem that JESUS CHRIST cannot solve — Kiran`

In September we almost lost him. As per the doctors his heart stopped for few seconds and they had to resuscitate him and he was in ICU for almost a month on ventilator. The doctors were pushing us as a family to discontinue him from the ventilator, to pull the plug and take him off life support. But my sister’s family and I and everybody in the family decided to go forward and not do that. Now my father is  in rehab, four months now. He is beginning to eat and going for therapy. He is taking few steps. He is very alert. He knows who I am on the phone. He is able to recognize. He has conversation. He wants more food which is a good sign for him. He loves to eat.

I wanted to become mad but my faith tells me that I must show Christ’s love to him. I was praying that, Lord I don’t know how to handle this situation. That was the time one of my friends invited me to “Adonai’s Gathering”. We came and the Pastor gave us Isaiah 41:13. I carried that word throughout the whole project. What  people were doing to sabotage the project, became a success to me. It became such a huge success that I got an award. That’s how God works! I know that I was good in what I was doing. But I was failing. Pastor prayed over us and I carried Isaiah 41:13 all through the project. This is my testimony for the glory of God – ‘from disaster to success’.  - Prasad`

			'In 2013 at that service in Houston Jesus healed me; the preacher came and touched me and God used him and God gave me healing',
		description: `
04/18/14  You know, I give glory to God for you and thank you and God bless you. I wanted to give a testimony today. Because with God all we do or have where we are in life is because of him. Like he told pilot before he was crucified. Jesus said “You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. John 19:11 and when we are close to Jesus amazing things happen. He also says Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. James 4:8 Since 19 yrs. old I have been working to be like Jesus and have salvation thoroughly Christ.  Just like everyone I have had my ups and downs. But always in all things I go to God to have the glory. Last year my husband took me to a healing service and I was a little skeptical about it at first. But my husband insisted so we went and I felt the spirit of the living God there that day. And the preacher came and touched me and God used him and God gave me healing. That day I stopped taking my medication.  that the doctors said I would take the rest of my life. But in 2011 when they said that. I was like ok I will wait on The Lord and he will heal me on his timing. But till then I will take the medication. And it was not easy I lost a lot of hair was going through depression , weight gain , and severe migraines . Were some of what was wrong with me. And in 2013 at that service in Houston Jesus healed me. My husband emailed them 4/17/14 and told them my testimony on being healed and he email back the same day. And also was thankful and glorified The Lord. He sent this scripture not knowing anything else about me. “From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained. They’ll look forward to having children again and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them.” (Jer 30:19,20) and it touched our hearts.  Because every word is true. We are so great full for this new baby to add to our family and glad to share this with you  all. God is so merciful. I was so over joyed and great full that a righteous just and true loving God could me so good to a unworthy human like me . Thank you.  -  Teresa`

He said there will not be any rain since he has already prayed. But We could see water, Dark clouds and lightning everywhere. I said OK brother. You know what you are saying and I reluctantly went with him. We started the crusade on Thursday at 7 PM. We had the crusade on Friday and on Saturday evenings. There was not even a drop of water in the city. We could get the news that there is heavy rain and flooding everywhere. God stopped the rain all three days. We had tremendous testimonies of Miracles. On Sunday at 6 AM, we packed up our things and got into our vehicle. Guess what! Rain started. We reached Dallas in the evening. I heard the news from a woman who came from the city,that the rain has not stopped since that Sunday morning. They tried to continue the crusade outside on that Sunday evening. Guess what! They could not. If God could stop the rain to do His work that is a miracle. If God could start the rain when we left, that is a miracle too. Gloria a Dios. Dios Te Bendiga. `
